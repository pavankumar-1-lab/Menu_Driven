📌 Overview  
This project demonstrates efficient array management in C, allowing users to dynamically **insert** and **delete** elements at the **beginning**, **end**, or **specific positions** of a 1D array. Designed for educational and practical use, it emphasizes:  
- **Memory management** (dynamic reallocation)  
- **User-friendly CLI** (menu-driven interface)  
- **Error handling** (input validation, bounds checking)

## 🛠️ Setup & Execution  

### **Prerequisites**  
1. **MinGW** (for Windows GCC compiler):  
   - Download [MinGW Installer](https://osdn.net/projects/mingw/)  
   - Select `gcc-core` during installation  
   - Add `C:\MinGW\bin` to your system PATH  

### **Compilation & Execution**  
1. **Save your code** as `driven.c`  
2. Open **Git Bash** or terminal in VS Code:  
   ```bash
   # Compile the program
   gcc driven.c -o array_manager

   # Run the executable
   ./array_manager
   ```

| Operation         | Description                                  |  
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------|  
| **Insert**        | At start, end, or custom position           |  
| **Delete**        | From start, end, or custom position         |  
| **Dynamic Resize**| Automatic memory reallocation               |

## 📋 Usage Example  
```text
=== Array Operations Menu ===  
1. Insert at Beginning  
2. Insert at End  
3. Insert at Position  
4. Delete from Beginning  
5. Delete from End  
6. Delete from Position  
7. Display Array  
8. Exit  

Enter choice: 1  
Enter value: 42  
→ Inserted 42 at position 0  
```
